# DermAI: Skin Disease Prediction and Solutions

DermAI is a machine learning project developed to predict skin diseases based on input images and provide solutions for further action. This project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of skin disease images to make predictions.

# Demonstration of the Project
